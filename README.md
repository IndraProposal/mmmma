# Metamathematical Molecular Modeling Algorithm

This repository contains an algorithm that integrates metamathematics with molecular structures for advanced computational modeling.

## Description

The Metamathematical Molecular Modeling Algorithm (MMMM) is a novel approach that combines the principles of metamathematics with the representation of molecular structures. This interdisciplinary algorithm allows for the exploration of complex mathematical concepts within the context of molecular modeling.

The MMMM can be used for various applications, including:

* **Interdisciplinary Research:** Bridging the gap between mathematics and molecular biology.
* **Scientific Simulations:** Creating accurate and detailed simulations of molecular interactions.
* **Theoretical Exploration:** Investigating mathematical concepts through the lens of molecular structures.

## Usage

To use the MMMM, you first need to import the `metamath_molecular_modeling` module. Then, you can create a metamathematical molecular model by calling the appropriate functions within the module.

Functions include:

* `create_molecular_structure()`: Constructs a molecular structure.
* `apply_metamathematics()`: Applies metamathematical principles to the molecular structure.
* `simulate_interaction()`: Simulates interactions between molecular structures.
* `visualize_model()`: Visualizes the metamathematical molecular model.

## Example

The following code creates a metamathematical molecular model and visualizes it:

```python
import metamath_molecular_modeling

structure = metamath_molecular_modeling.create_molecular_structure(["H", "O", "H"])
metamath_molecular_modeling.apply_metamathematics(structure)
metamath_molecular_modeling.visualize_model(structure)
```

## Documentation

The documentation for the Metamathematical Molecular Modeling Algorithm is available in the `docs` directory of the repository.
